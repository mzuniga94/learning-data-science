## NumPyBasics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation

### Benefits of NumPy:
* _ndarray_, an efficient multidimensional array for fast array-oriented arithmetic operations and broadcasting capabilities.
* Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays without having to write loops.
* Tools for reading/writing data to disk and working with memory-mapped files.
* Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities.
* A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN.

NumPy does not provide data modeling or scientific functionality, however, it is important to understand NumPy to use tools like pandas. NumPy provides a computational foundation for general numerical data processing. For statistics, pandas provides a good basis.
